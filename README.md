# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 1. Passwords with Varying Complexity
| Password         | Complexity Type          |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| elevate123       | Simple, lowercase + numbers |
| Elev@te01        | Mixed case + number + symbol |
| cats*Pits01      | Complex, random words + symbols |
| !Qw9zT@3Lm7#     | Fully random, high complexity |

## 2. Testing with Online Password Strength Checker
**Tool used:** [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)  
(Results may vary slightly depending on the tool.)

| Password         | Score (%) | Feedback |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| elevate123       | 44%       | Too short, predictable word, lacks special characters & uppercase |
| Elev@te01        | 79%       | Good mix of characters, medium length; could be longer for higher security |
| cats*Pits01      | 87%       | Strong, contains symbols, mixed case, and numbers; slightly predictable words |
| !Qw9zT@3Lm7#     | 100%      | Very strong, fully random, long, high entropy |

## 3. Best Practices & tips for creating strong passwords.
- **Length matters:** Aim for at least 12–16 characters.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
- Avoid **common words, names, and sequences**.
- Consider **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue@Sun_94!Moon`) for memorability and strength.
- Use **unique passwords** for each account.
- Store passwords in a **password manager** instead of writing them down.
- Always enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

## 4. Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Systematically tries every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses lists of common words/passwords.
- **Phishing Attack:** Tricks users into revealing credentials.
- **Keylogging:** Captures everything typed on the keyboard.

## 5. How Complexity Affects Security
- Simple passwords (`elevate123`) can be cracked almost instantly by automated tools.
- Medium-complex passwords (`Elev@te01`) are better but still crackable within hours/days with modern computing.
- Strong, unique passwords (`cats*Pits01` and `!Qw9zT@3Lm7#`) can take years or even centuries to crack depending on length and randomness.
